The purpose of marketing is to match the genuine needs and desires of consumers with the offers of suppliers particularly suited to satisfy those needs and desires. This matching process benefits consumers and suppliers and drives an organizationâ€™s marketing planning process. Marketing planning is a logical sequence and a series of activities leading to the setting of marketing objectives and the formulation of plans to achieve them (McDonald and Wilson 2011, p. 24). A marketing plan consists of two components: a strategic and a tactical marketing plan. The strategic plan outlines the long-term direction of an organization but does not provide much detail on the short-term marketing action required to move in this long-term direction. The tactical marketing plan does the opposite. It translates the long-term strategic plan into detailed instructions for short-term marketing action. The strategic marketing plan states where the organization wants to go and why. The tactical marketing plan contains instructions on what needs to be done to get there.
